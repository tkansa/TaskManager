# TaskManager
C#.NET CAPSTONE: TASK LIST


Intro: Jill, a project manager on your team, comes to you with an idea for a project. “So far you’ve been doing great work,” she says, 
“so I’d like to ask you to take on an extra project. We’ve been having trouble meeting our goals on time, and no app we’ve tried really fits out model. 
We’d like to build our own task management web app. Can you start building us a task manager?”


Task: Create a web-based task manager


What Will the Application Do?
*  The user can create a new task.  Tasks consist of:
   * A task description
   * The due date
   * Whether it’s complete or not
*  The user should see a list of all tasks
   * There should be a button or checkbox  to mark the task complete
   * There should be a button to delete the task
* For MVP, you do not need to provide user authentication or state management--this can be a single task list shared across all users


Build Specifications
1. Build this as an MVC web application in .NET Core 3.0
2. Store tasks in a MS SQL database table and use Entity Framework or Dapper (your choice) for ORM
3. Minimum views: Welcome/login page, task list, add task view


Extended Challenges
* Let the user search for a task by a word or words in the description
* Let the user sort or filter by due date
* Let the user sort or filter by completion status




E:  10-9
M:  6 - 8
